        <h3>Agreement & Acceptance</h3>
        <p><strong>Binding Agreement:</strong> This quotation is valid for acceptance for 90 days from the date of issue. Acceptance must be confirmed in writing (e.g., via email or by signing and returning this document). In the absence of written confirmation, a verbal or written instruction for work to commence will constitute your full acceptance of this quotation and all terms and conditions contained herein.</p>
        <p><strong>Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 (CGA):</strong> For residential projects, this agreement is subject to the guarantees outlined in the CGA, which ensure that our services are provided with reasonable care and skill, are fit for purpose, and are completed within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
        <p><strong>Construction Contracts Act 2002 (CCA):</strong> All painting work is defined as "construction work" under the CCA. All invoices issued by Tomar Contracting Limited will be in the form of a "Payment Claim" under the Act.</p>
        <h3>Project Execution & Site Management</h3>
        <p><strong>Weather Contingency:</strong> Exterior painting is strictly weather-dependent. Work cannot proceed during rain, in high winds, when humidity is above 85%, or when temperatures are below the paint manufacturer's minimum specification (typically 10°C). The agreed-upon project timeline will be extended to account for any days lost due to adverse weather, and Tomar Contracting Limited shall not be held liable for such delays. We will maintain proactive communication regarding any weather-related schedule changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Site Access & Client Responsibilities:</strong> The client agrees to provide clear, safe, and unimpeded access to all work areas for the duration of the project. Prior to our arrival, we request that you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove all vehicles from driveways and nearby parking spaces.</li>
          <li>Relocate all outdoor furniture, pot plants, BBQs, and decorative items away from the house.</li>
          <li>Trim back any trees, shrubs, or vines that are touching or within 60cm of the surfaces to be painted.</li>
          <li>Ensure pets and children are kept clear of the work area at all times for their safety.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Health & Safety:</strong> All work will be conducted in strict accordance with the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. Our team is SiteSafe certified and will operate under a site-specific safety plan. The client has a duty to inform us of any known hazards on the property, such as asbestos, unstable structures, or faulty wiring, prior to work commencing.</p>
        <h3>Scope, Variations & Unforeseen Conditions</h3>
        <p><strong>Variations:</strong> Any work requested by the client that falls outside the scope of work will be treated as a variation. All variations will be quoted in writing, detailing the additional cost and any impact on the project timeline. Work on a variation will only commence after we receive your written approval.</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-Existing Conditions (Repaint Work):</strong> This quotation is based on the assumption that all existing substrates and underlying paint layers are sound. Tomar Contracting Limited is not responsible for the failure of previous coatings. If the new paint system fails due to an underlying layer losing adhesion, this is expressly excluded from our workmanship guarantee.</p>
        <p><strong>Unforeseen Issues:</strong> Any significant defects discovered only after work has commenced (e.g., extensive timber rot, structural damage, or moisture ingress hidden beneath existing paint) are excluded from this fixed-price quote. Upon discovery, work in the affected area will cease, we will notify you immediately with a clear explanation and photographic evidence, and we will provide a priced variation for the necessary remedial work. Work will not resume in that area until the variation is approved.</p>
        <p><strong>Lead-Based Paint Discovery:</strong> For properties built before the 1980s, we assume the absence of lead-based paint unless advised otherwise. If lead-based paint is suspected or discovered during preparation, all work in the affected area will cease immediately. We will notify you and provide a priced variation for the specialised containment, removal, and disposal procedures required to comply with WorkSafe New Zealand guidelines.</p>
        <p><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Unless explicitly included in the Scope of Work, this quote excludes: major carpentry or plastering repairs, painting of interior window surfaces, gutter interiors, and any areas not listed in the quote.</p>
        <h3>Warranties, Liability & Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p><strong>Workmanship Guarantee:</strong> We provide a comprehensive workmanship guarantee on the application of the specified paint system against peeling, flaking, or blistering resulting from defective application. We also provide a one-month follow-up inspection to address any necessary touch-ups. This guarantee is separate from the paint manufacturer's product warranty and does not cover damage caused by moisture ingress, substrate movement, accidental damage by others, or normal wear and tear.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Our maximum aggregate liability for any claim is limited to the total contract price. While all care is taken, older glass can become brittle and may crack during the vibrations of sanding and preparation; we are not liable for such breakages unless caused by direct negligence.</p>
        <p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> In the unlikely event of a dispute, both parties agree to first attempt resolution through direct, good-faith negotiation. If unresolved, the matter may be referred to mediation or adjudication under the CCA.</p>
